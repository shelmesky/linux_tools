dsniff for Debian
-----------------

Dsniff should depend on libx11-6 because webspy use it. But forcing to the user to install a lot of X stuff in a server for one (and maybe useless, in certain environments) binary. If you want to use webspy, please run this command before:

apt-get install libx11-6
